# 🌟 VEX 🌟

Welcome to **FrenchFive's VEX Repository**! 

This repository showcases a collection of VEX scripts designed for procedural workflows in Houdini. 

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Houdini artist, these scripts will help you streamline your projects and bring your ideas to life. 🎨✨

I mainly do it for myself to have a place to easly get access to this code. And share it with poeple that may need it one day.

## 📋 **What's Inside?**
This repository features a variety of **VEX snippets** and **full scripts** tailored for tasks like:
- 🌌 **Generating Procedural Geometry**
- 🎨 **Customizing Attributes**
- 💡 **Optimizing Simulation Workflows**
- 🔧 **Automating Repetitive Tasks**

## 🚀 **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrenchFive/VEX.git
   ```
2. **Import VEX Scripts in Houdini:**  
   - Copy and paste the code into a **Wrangle Node** (e.g., Point Wrangle, Attribute Wrangle).
   - Adjust parameters and attributes as needed.

3. **Experiment and Create:**  
   These scripts are modular and easy to customize. Mix and match to fit your procedural needs!
   I try my best to leave as many comments as possible for clarity .. but its not always the case.

## 🌟 **Highlighted Scripts**

### **1. Ambient Occlusion Mask**  
Generate an **Ambient Occlusion Mask** using raycasting techniques to calculate occlusion for geometry.  
🔑 *Great for enhancing detail and realism in your scenes.*

### **2. Procedural Noise Effects**  
Create dynamic and customizable **noise patterns** for attributes like `@Cd` or `@P`.  
🔑 *Perfect for texturing or adding randomness to your designs.*

### **3. Attribute Manipulation Tools**  
Fine-tune attributes (`@P`, `@N`, `@Cd`, etc.) with powerful yet simple VEX expressions.  
🔑 *Ideal for artistic control and procedural effects.*
